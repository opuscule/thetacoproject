  "quote": "This place is absolutely delicious! They mix and match tacos so I got salmon, seared shrimp, and seared cod. The sauces and extras made the flavors pop! It was seafood heaven. They take drinks you can order as well. And did I mention the servers are all very nice? I highly recommend this place. I'm coming back for a burrito bowl next time!",
