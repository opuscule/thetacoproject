  "quote": "Taco project never disappoints. Any of Nick’s 6 locations executes above and beyond on every order. The spread is well prepared fresh, and the presentation is immaculate. Hands down the best caterer I’ve ever worked with and if you want to leisurely enjoy the restaurant on your free time the personal dishes are phenomenal as are the cocktails they curate on a seasonal basis! Thank you!",
